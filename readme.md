# CAOS for Analytics | Host Google Analytics Locally

Automagically download analytics.js, keep it updated using WordPress' built-in Cron-schedule, generate the tracking code, add it to your site's header or footer and tons of other features!

## Description

CAOS for Google Analytics allows you to **host analytics.js** locally and keep it updated using WordPress' built-in Cron-schedule. Fully automatic!

Whenever you run an analysis of your website on *Google Pagespeed Insights*, *Pingdom* or *GTMetrix*, it'll tell you to **leverage browser cache** when you're using Google Analytics. Because Google has set the cache expiry time to 2 hours. This plugin will get you a **higher score** on Pagespeed and Pingdom and make **your website load faster**, because the user's browser doesn't have to make a roundtrip to download the file from Google's external server.

Just install the plugin, enter your Tracking-ID and the plugin adds the necessary Tracking Code for Google Analytics to the header (or footer) of your theme, downloads and saves the analytics.js-file to your website's server and keeps it updated (automagically) using a scheduled script in wp_cron(). CAOS for Analytics is a set and forget plugin.
