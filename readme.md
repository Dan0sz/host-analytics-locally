# CAOS | Host Google Analytics Locally

Automagically download and update analytics.js/ga.js/gtag.js, bypass Ad Blockers with Stealth Mode, add the tracking code to your site's footer and tons of other features!

## Description
CAOS (Complete Analytics Optimization Suite) for Google Analytics allows you to **host analytics.js/gtag.js/ga.js** locally and keep it updated using WordPress' built-in Cron-schedule. Fully automatic!

Whenever you run an analysis of your website on *Google Pagespeed Insights*, *Pingdom* or *GTMetrix*, it'll tell you to **leverage browser cache** when you're using Google Analytics. Because Google has set the cache expiry time to 2 hours. This plugin will get you a **higher score** on Pagespeed and Pingdom and make **your website load faster**, because the user's browser doesn't have to make a roundtrip to download the file from Google's external server.

Just install the plugin, enter your Tracking-ID and the plugin adds the necessary Tracking Code for Google Analytics to the header (or footer) of your theme, downloads and saves the analytics.js/ga.js/gtag.js-file to your website's server and keeps it updated (automagically) using a scheduled script in wp_cron(). CAOS is a set and forget plugin.

Please keep in mind that, although I try to make the configuration of this plugin as easy as possible, the concept of locally hosting a file or optimizing Google Analytics for *Pagespeed Insights* or *GT Metrix* has proven to be confusing for some people. If you're not sure of what your doing, please consult a SEO expert or Webdeveloper to help you with the configuration and optimization of your WordPress blog. Or feel free to [contact me](https://daan.dev/contact/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=caos) for a quote.
