Automagically download and update analytics.js/ga.js/gtag.js, bypass Ad Blockers with Stealth Mode, add the tracking code to your site's footer and tons of other features!

== Description ==

CAOS (Complete Analytics Optimization Suite) for Google Analytics allows you to **host analytics.js/gtag.js/ga.js** locally and keep it updated using WordPress' built-in Cron-schedule. Fully automatic!

Whenever you run an analysis of your website on *Google Pagespeed Insights*, *Pingdom* or *GTMetrix*, it'll tell you to **leverage browser cache** when you're using Google Analytics. Because Google has set the cache expiry time to 2 hours. This plugin will get you a **higher score** on Pagespeed and Pingdom and make **your website load faster**, because the user's browser doesn't have to make a roundtrip to download the file from Google's external server.

Just install the plugin, enter your Tracking-ID and the plugin adds the necessary Tracking Code for Google Analytics to the header (or footer) of your theme, downloads and saves the analytics.js/ga.js/gtag.js-file to your website's server and keeps it updated (automagically) using a scheduled script in wp_cron(). CAOS is a set and forget plugin.

Please keep in mind that, although I try to make the configuration of this plugin as easy as possible, the concept of locally hosting a file or optimizing Google Analytics for *Pagespeed Insights* or *GT Metrix* has proven to be confusing for some people. If you're not sure of what your doing, please consult a SEO expert or Webdeveloper to help you with the configuration and optimization of your WordPress blog. Or feel free to [contact me](https://daan.dev/contact/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=caos) for a quote.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have another file I want to host locally. Could you make a plugin? =

Maintaining two plugins besides my daily 9-to-5 job is a handful, so no. If you're looking for a way to host Google Webfonts locally; please install [OMGF](https://wordpress.org/plugins/host-webfonts-local/). For anything else, please follow the steps in [this how-to](https://daan.dev/how-to/host-js-locally-crontab/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=caos).

= CAOS says analytics.js/gtag.js/ga.js isn't updated in more than two days. What's going on? =

This is due to server configuration. Probably a permissions issue. It might be that PHP/WordPress isn't allowed to create files programmatically. If you can upload media files just fine, then this probably isn't the issue. Is your cron running? Try clicking the 'update analytics.js/gtag.js/ga.js' option to update the file manually. Meanwhile, contact your hosting provider so they can help you figure out if your cron is running correctly.

= I have disabled the plugin, but the Google Analytics tracking code is still added to the page. What's going on? =

This question has been asked on the support forum lots of times and in ALL cases it was caused by a Full Page Caching plugin, such as WP Fastest Cache or WP Super Cache, or another caching mechanism, such as Varnish. Possibly the page containing the snippet was cached in its entirety, and that cached version is still loading. Try flushing the plugin's cache and empty your browser's cache. Then reload the page.

= After installing this plugin I'm getting a 'Load resources from a consistent URL'-error on Google Pagespeed or GT Metrix. How can I fix this? =

CAOS *adds* a modified version of the Google Analytics tracking code to your header or footer, depending on your settings. If you're getting this notification (or optimization suggestion) this means that besides the GA tracking code added by CAOS, you're also loading a second tracking code somewhere else in your blog. Possibly in your theme's options or by another Google Analytics plugin. Remove/disable this and you're good to go.

= Is this plugin GDPR compliant? =

Yes, it is! It is compatible with all Wordpress Cookie Notice plugins which either set a cookie to allow tracking or set a certain value to a cookie to allow tracking. It's completely customizable!

= Google Tag Assistant says analytics.js is missing. Is this normal? =

Yes, this is normal. This browser extensions looks for this exact string 'www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js'. Because with CAOS you're hosting it locally, Tag Assistant doesn't find this string and returns an error. However, you can still use Tag Assistant to verify tracking works.

= I use Google Analytics by Monster Insights. Is CAOS compatible with that plugin? =

Yes, it is! Since version 1.80 CAOS is completely compatible with Google Analytics for Wordpress by Monster Insights. Just enable the option 'Enable compatibility with Monster Insights?' within the 'Optimize Analytics'-screen and CAOS will automagically replace the default external source of analytics.js to your locally hosted file.

= Is CAOS compatible with WooCommerce? =

Yes, it is! CAOS is completely compatible with WooCommerce. If you're a WooCommerce-user, install WooCommerce Google Analytics Integration (compatible since v2.6.4) or Monster Insights' Google Analytics (compatible since v1.8.0) plugin and enable the corresponding compatibility mode in CAOS.

= I use WP Super Cache / W3 Total Cache / Autoptimize or another Caching and/or Minification plugin. Why is it removing analytics.js when I flush my cache? =

This happens because analytics.js is saved within the 'cache'-folder and for some reason the cache/minify plugin thinks it should be refreshed. Change the path where analytics.js is saved within CAOS to a path outside the /cache/ folder (e.g. /caos-cache/analytics/). This should resolve any issues you're having.

= WordFence (or another security plugin) is detecting file changes in analytics.js/gtag.js/ga.js. What's going on? =

This is perfectly normal, since this is the file that was updated by the built-in cronjob in older versions of CAOS. Update to the latest version and change the path where analytics.js is saved within CAOS to a path which is ignored by your security plugin (e.g. /uploads/ or /cache/). This should resolve any issues you're having.

= What is the current update interval of the Analytics-script? =

I have set it to daily, because Google updates the script very often. Also, the daily interval is the longest interval that wp_cron() allows, as far as I know. If you suspect you might've gotten behind (which I doubt) I've implement a manual update button within the CAOS' settings.

= The ga.js/analytics.js/gtag.js-file remains empty! What should I do? =

Make sure you are running the latest version, as I added some compatibility fixes along the way. If this doesn't resolve your issue, then your wp-cron isn't working properly. This is a server related issue. You can add the 'includes/update-analytics.php'-file to [your crontab](http://crontab-generator.org/ "Click here to create a crontab line using Crontab Generator"). As this problem has been resolved many times already, check the forum!

= I just updated to the latest version and the tracking stopped working! =

Probably your gtag.js/analytics.js/ga.js file got overwritten and emptied. Try activating and de-activating the plugin, otherwise this will automatically resolve itself after the cronjob has run.

= I disabled Demographic Reports in Google Analytics, but the script is still redirecting to doubleclick.net. How do I turn this off? =

Try enabling the option called "Disable all display features functionality?" With this you can enforce the disabling of the DisplayFeatures plugin.

= I've installed your plugin but analytics.js/ga.js/gtag.js is still showing up as an external request in Pingdom e.a.? =

CAOS adds a local file called gtag.js/analytics.js/gtag.js (depending on your choice), which enables you to use Analytics, while hosting the necessary files locally. This doesn't mean that it scans your entire plugins or themes directory for other manually/programatically added Analytics tracking-code. I.e. If analytics.js or ga.js is still showing up in the list of requests, this mean that something else (probably the theme you're using or another plugin) is adding this tracking code to your Wordpress Install. Find it. Remove it. And let CAOS take care of sending your needed data to Google Analytics.

= I use a CDN. Can I use CAOS in combination with my CDN? =

Yes, you can! Simply add the URL of your CDN within the advanced options and analytics.js/gtag.js/ga.js will be served from your CDN.

= Can I buy you a beer? =

Yes, please! [Click here to buy me a beer](http://daan.dev/donate/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=description&utm_campaign=caos "Let's do shots!")!
