Automagically download analytics.js, keep it updated using WordPress' built-in Cron-schedule, generate the tracking code, add it to your site's header or footer and tons of other features!

== Description ==

CAOS for Google Analytics allows you to **host analytics.js** locally and keep it updated using WordPress' built-in Cron-schedule. Fully automatic!

Whenever you run an analysis of your website on *Google Pagespeed Insights*, *Pingdom* or *GTMetrix*, it'll tell you to **leverage browser cache** when you're using Google Analytics. Because Google has set the cache expiry time to 2 hours. This plugin will get you a **higher score** on Pagespeed and Pingdom and make **your website load faster**, because the user's browser doesn't have to make a roundtrip to download the file from Google's external server.

Just install the plugin, enter your Tracking-ID and the plugin adds the necessary Tracking Code for Google Analytics to the header (or footer) of your theme, downloads and saves the analytics.js-file to your website's server and keeps it updated (automagically) using a scheduled script in wp_cron(). CAOS for Analytics is a set and forget plugin.

== Features ==
- Host analytics.js/ga.js locally,
- Allow tracking always or only when a certain cookie exists or has a value -- [Read more about GDPR Compliance](https://dev.daanvandenbergh.com/wordpress/gdpr-compliance-google-analytics/),
- Add tracking code to header, footer or manually,
- Enable [compatibility with *Monster Insights' Google Analytics for Wordpress (and WooCommerce)*](https://dev.daanvandenbergh.com/wordpress/leverage-browser-caching-host-analytics-local-monster-insights/),
- Save analytics.js anywhere within the WordPress content (wp-content) directory to avoid detection by WordPress security plugins (such as WordFence) or removal by caching plugins (such as WP Super Cache),
- Set Cookie Expiry Period,
- Set Adjusted Bounce Rate,
- Change enqueue order (prioritize order of loaded scripts),
- Force disabling display features functionalities,
- Anonymize IP addresses,
- Track logged in Administrators,
- Remove script from wp-cron, so you can add it manually to your Crontab,
- Manually update analytics.js by the click of a button!

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/host-analyticsjs-local` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins repository directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Settings -> Optimize Analytics screen to configure the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have another file I want to host locally. Could you make a plugin? =

Maintaining two plugins besides my daily 9-to-5 job is a handful, so no. If you're looking for a way to host Google Webfonts locally; please install [CAOS for Webfonts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/host-webfonts-local/). For anything else, please follow the steps in [this how-to](https://dev.daanvandenbergh.com/how-to/host-js-locally-crontab/).

= Is this plugin GDPR compliant? =

Yes, it is! It is compatible with all Wordpress Cookie Notice plugins which either set a cookie to allow tracking or set a certain value to a cookie to allow tracking. It's completely customizable!

= Google Tag Assistant says analytics.js is missing. Is this normal? =

Yes, this is normal. This browser extensions looks for this exact string 'www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js'. Because with CAOS for Analytics you're hosting it locally, Tag Assistant doesn't find this string and returns an error. However, you can still use Tag Assistant to verify tracking works.

= I use Google Analytics by Monster Insights. Is CAOS compatible with that plugin? =

Yes, it is! Since version 1.80 CAOS is completely compatible with Google Analytics for Wordpress by Monster Insights. Just enable the option 'Enable compatibility with Monster Insights?' within the 'Optimize Analytics'-screen and CAOS will automagically replace the default external source of analytics.js to your locally hosted file.

= Is CAOS compatible with WooCommerce? =

Yes, it is! Since version 1.80 CAOS is completely compatible with WooCommerce. If you're a WooCommerce-user, I suggest integrating Google Analytics for Wordpress by Monster Insights with WooCommerce to take advantage of the advanced e-Commerce tracking capabilities of Google Analytics. Just enable the option 'Enable compatibility with Monster Insights?' within the 'Optimize Analytics'-screen and CAOS will automagically replace the default external source of analytics.js to your locally hosted file.

= I use WP Super Cache / W3 Total Cache / Autoptimize or another Caching and/or Minification plugin. Why is it removing analytics.js when I flush my cache? =

This happens because analytics.js is saved within the 'cache'-folder and for some reason the cache/minify plugin thinks it should be refreshed. Change the path where analytics.js is saved within CAOS to a path outside the /cache/ folder (e.g. /caos-cache/analytics/). This should resolve any issues you're having.

= WordFence (or another security plugin) is detecting file changes in local-ga.js. What's going on? =

This is perfectly normal, since this is the file that was updated by the built-in cronjob in older versions of CAOS for Analytics. Update to the latest version and change the path where analytics.js is saved within CAOS to a path which is ignored by your security plugin (e.g. /uploads/ or /cache/). This should resolve any issues you're having.

= Is CAOS compatible with WooCommerce Google Analytics Integration? =

No, sadly it isn't, because that plugin doesn't offer CAOS a efficient way to change the source of the analytics.js-file. However if you want to use CAOS with WooCommerce, I suggest using [Google Analytics by Monster Insights](https://nl.wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/).

= What is the current update interval of the Analytics-script? =

I have set it to daily, because Google updates the script very often. Also, the daily interval is the longest interval that wp_cron() allows, as far as I know. If you suspect you might've gotten behind (which I doubt) I've implement a manual update button within the CAOS for Analytics' settings.

= The ga-local.js-file remains empty! What should I do? =

Make sure you are running the latest version, as I added some compatibility fixes along the way. If this doesn't resolve your issue, then your wp-cron isn't working properly. This is a server related issue. You can add the 'includes/update-analytics.php'-file to [your crontab](http://crontab-generator.org/ "Click here to create a crontab line using Crontab Generator"). As this problem has been resolved many times already, check the forum!

= I just updated to the latest version and the tracking stopped working! =

Probably your ga-local.js file got overwritten and emptied. Try activating and de-activating the plugin, otherwise this will automatically resolve itself after the cronjob has run.

= I disabled Demographic Reports in Google Analytics, but the script is still redirecting to doubleclick.net. How do I turn this off? =

Try enabling the option called "Disable all display features functionality?" With this you can enforce the disabling of the DisplayFeatures plugin.

= I've installed your plugin but analytics.js/ga.js is still showing up as an external request in Pingdom e.a.? =

CAOS adds a local file called ga-local.js, which enables you to use Analytics, while hosting the necessary files locally. This doesn't mean that it scans your entire plugins or themes directory for other manually/programatically added Analytics tracking-code. I.e. If analytics.js or ga.js is still showing up in the list of requests, this mean that something else (probably the theme you're using or another plugin) is adding this tracking code to your Wordpress Install. Find it. Remove it. And let CAOS take care of sending your needed data to Google Analytics.

= I use a CDN. Can I use CAOS in combination with my CDN? =

Yes, while I tried to add a CDN-function to CAOS, this seemed to create more problems than it'd solve. But @sixer came up with a great alternative, created by my friends @keycdn: CDN Enabler. Add the path to this plugin's directory to CDN Enabler and the analytics.js script is pulled directly from your CDN.

= Can I buy you a beer? =

Yes, please! [Click here to buy me a beer](http://dev.daanvandenbergh.com/donate/ "Let's do shots!")!
